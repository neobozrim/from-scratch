			<h1>The EDD Trap</h1>
			<p><i>EDD: Emotionally-Driven Development</i></p>
			<p>When it is someone’s emotions instead of verified user needs that drive product decisions, you are in an EDD trap (Emotionally-Driven Development trap). It’s quite easy to fall in those as we, human beings, happen to be emotional creatures. Before we discuss ways to avoid doing emotionally-driven product development, let's see how we can tell EDD.</p>

			<h2>How to tell EDD:</h2>
			<p>There are two typical emotional states that lead to EDD:</p>

			<ol>
			<li><b>Over-confidence/over-excitement:</b> You don’t want to be slowed down by unnecessary user research, because you just know that the feature or product is going to be a great success. It’s so obvious.</li>
			<li><b>Fear of failure:</b> There is so much urgency and stress around delivering a feature that you can’t afford to pause even for an hour and think about it. You’re already late! How did you even miss that in the first place? Come on! It should have been done by now!</li> 
			</ol> 

			<h2>What’s wrong with EDD</h2>
			<p>Problem is, because of the emotionally-driven rush to deliver, it is easy to miss important details (such as why exactly are we building this or what is our go-to-market strategy). And often times, having missed important details, the development of an EDD-driven product or feature takes longer than we thought or it doesn’t turn out as successful and useful as expected.</p>

			<h2>How to avoid EDD</h2>
			<ul>
			<li><b>Step 1:</b> Put your ego behind. For a moment forget about all the glory that's awaiting you after you deliver the feature as well as the potential down-side of failing to save the day with that extra push you're planning.</li>

			<li><b>Step 2:</b> Pause and ask yourself “why”. Why are we building this? What are we aiming to achieve with it? What problem are we trying to solve?</li>

			<li><b>Step 3:</b> Does the problem exist in the minds of the people who are using our product? Can we validate we’re about to make anybody’s life easier, BEFORE we’ve developed anything? Go and find out. Speak to your users. It might turn out that they have totally different problems than what you are trying to solve right now.</li>
			</ul>
