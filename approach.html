			<h1>Approach</h1>

			<p><b>We all agree</b> that a successful product person needs to understand the target market, be able to coin a strategy about how to attack it, motivate people, manage priorities and make tough decisions when needed.<br><br><b><i> However, any product person should ALSO BE ABLE TO...</i></b> </p>

			<h2>... uncover a core user need</h2>
			<p>Before you start "attacking" that market, make sure to first speak to the people who'll be buying and using your product. Look for what you haven't already thought of. <b>Don't bias respondents to what you want to hear - hear what they have to say.</b></p>
			<p>You can read about some of my early user interview experiences on my blog: <a href="https://medium.com/yavor-popov">The Prototype and the Human</a>.</p>

			<h2>... piece together a prototype</h2>
			<p>Especially when you wake up with yet another genius idea, prototype it real quick. Just put it together in any form. This will help you uncover its not-so-genius aspects that you haven't thought of. Then show it to UX, dev and some stakeholders. Get their first thoughts. Sometimes a quick prototype can save you and your team weeks of back and forth and wasteful work. Besides, <b>you might find out that your ideas are not always that genius after all.</b></p>
			<p>Here's one of my recent game prototypes - in gif format:</p>

			<h2>... define the use cases before the user stories</h2>
			<p>A user story is about a little peace of customer value, while a use case is about the context in which that value exists. <b>Map the context first. Draw the details later.</b></p>
			<p>Let's look at an example of a simply structured use case for the now popular game of Hearthstone.</p>
			<!--First, here's a sample player turn in the game.
			<video width="400" controls muted style="padding: 5%">
			  <source src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/hearthstone-use-case.mov">
			  Your browser does not support HTML5 video.
			</video>
			<p>Now let's jump to our use case.</p>-->

			<div style="background-color: #c9d1db; padding: 10px;">
				<p><b>USE CASE NAME:</b> Player's available actions on turn.</p>
				<p><b>ACTORS:</b> Player A, Player B</p>
				<p><b>PRE-CONDITIONS:</b> 
					<ul>
						<li>Player A and Player B participate in a game against each other;</li>
					    <li>Both players have selected their starting cards;</li>
					    <li>Player A is on turn;</li>
					</ul> 
				</p>
				<p><b>BASE FLOW:</b>
					<ul>
						<li>System draws a card from Player A's deck and includes it in the player's hand</li>
						<li>System highlights the available-to-play cards and actions that have mana cost lower or equal to Player A's free mana</li>
						<li>Player A plays an availble-to-play card or action</li>
						<li>System checks if there are card or action effects <u>that are triggered</u> by the played card or action </li>
						<li>System checks if there are card or action effects that <u>amend</u> the played card or action</li>
					</ul>
				</p>
				<p><b>POST-CONDITIONS:</b>
					<ul>
						<li>If there are triggered card or action effects, the System applies their effects to the playing board, all applicable characters in the game and both players' decks</li>
						<li>If applicable, the System amends the played card or action effects</li>
						<li>System applies the card or action effects to the playing board, all applicable characters in the game, both players' decks and/or the currently active card or action effects in the game</li>
						<li>System updates Player A's free mana</li>
						<li>System updates the highlighted available-to-play cards or actions</li>
						<li>If a Player hero's life is equal to or less than zero, game ends and the corresponding player loses the game</li>
					</ul>
				</p>
				<p><b>ALTERNATE FLOWS:</b>
					<ul>
						<li>- Player A ends their turn <br>
						<i>POST-CONDITION:</i> Player B is on turn</li>
						<br>
						<li>- Time to act has expired <br>
							- System automatically ends Player A's turn <br>
						<i>POST-CONDITION:</i> Player B is on turn</li>
					</ul>
				</p>
				<p><b>EXCEPTION FLOWS:</b></p>
				<ul>
					<li>- Player A attempts to play a card or action that costs more than the player's free mana <br>
						<i>POST-CONDITION:</i> System informs player that they don't have enough mana to play this
					</li>
					<br>
					<li>- Either Player A or Player B leaves the game during the turn<br>
						<i>POST-CONDITION:</i> That player loses the game, while the other one wins it</li>
					<br>
					<li>- Either Player A or Player B is disconnected<br>
						- System announces that to both players<br>
						- System attempts to re-establish connection<br>
						- System fails to re-establish connection for X number of seconds<br>
						<i>POST-CONDITION:</i> System ends the game, disconnected player loses, remaining player wins</li>
				</ul>

				<p><b>Mind you, though, that some people are more visual and get lost reading use cases.</b> So in order to make sure that everybody on your team better comprehends the use case, you could supply a flow chart to it. Here's the flow chart depicting our Base Flow. As soon as you have your first draft, go and show it to a dev and a UX person. Involving them early in the creation of your use cases and flow charts is key for the success of your product.</p>

				<br>
			    <br>
				<p><b>Finally, just imagine if the product person had only</b> created a single story about "...play a card or action in order to weaken my opponents's characters...". You'd be missing so many alternative and exception flows. Usually those will keep emerging during the development of the feature, creating tension and pushing your promised completion date farther... in turn, creating even more tention. <br>To avoid that, before you write a single user story, create your use cases. Treat a use case as a map of the user stories you need. And is there a product person who cannot benefit from such a map?</p>
