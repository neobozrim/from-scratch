			<h1>My approach</h1>
			<!--<p><i>A successful product person needs to understand the business domain and the market, be able to coin the product strategy, motivate people, manage priorities and make tough decisions when needed.<b> In addition, a product person should ALSO BE ABLE TO...</b></i></p> -->

			<h2>Start with WHY</h2>
			
			<p>A good product person thinks about the WHYs before they think about the WHATs. They tirelessly strive to uncover actual, real problems and customer needs before they start thinking about solutions. Anybody can come up with an idea for a cool feature. This is exactly why overall appx. 80% of software features are never used. Product management is not about prioritising features. It’s about solving the right problems. In fact, a product person can sometimes solve a customer problem by removing features!</b></p>
			<!--<p>You can read about some of my early user interview experiences on my blog: <a href="https://medium.com/yavor-popov">The Prototype and the Human</a>.</p>-->


		<h2>Surfing is cool, but it’s all about scuba diving</h2>

			<p>A good product person dives deep. They don’t roam the surface. The only way to make the right decisions about the present and future evolution of your product is by going deep. By that I mean getting an <i>intimate understanding</i> of your customers’ view on the world and the problems that THEY are trying to solve. Then you need to know the nitty gritty details of how your product works, so that you are completely aware of what problems you can solve. Then it’s about striking a balance. Knowing where we are at the moment and where our customers need to be, where should we take our product, so that everyone is at a better place down the road? You can’t answer that question without going deep.</b></p>
			<!--<p>Here's a game prototype (in gif format) that helped me invalidate a direction we could have taken a product.</p>
			<img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/QMHLZJNpbN3TCyKBHC/giphy.gif" alt="GIF IMAGE" width="100%">-->
	
			<h2>Be curious, listen and connect the dots</h2>
	
			<p>Who says that the product person is the only one who comes up with the right problems to solve? A good product person speaks to such a diverse range of people regularly, discusses so many topics with them, that inevitably those people end up sharing legitimate problems that are worth solving. The skill of the product person is in creating such conversations and really, really listening. The skill is in being able to <i>understand what you hear</i> and being able to tell a legitimate problem from all of the feature suggestions you are going to receive. Finally, you need to connect the dots. Good product decisions aren’t rocket science (in most cases). Typically they are just a creative interpretation of what everybody already knows.</p>
			
			<h2>Prioritize</h2>
	
			<p>You can’t make all of the people happy all of the time, right? You can’t solve all problems at once. You gotta say “no”. Invest some time in learning how to say “no” so that people keep wanting to work with you even after having heard that “no” a few times in a row. The key here is how you think of prioritisation, how clear your prioritisation principles are and how well you can explain them to your audience. </p>

			<h2>Give to receive</h2>
	
			<p>Regardless of where in the hierarchy your product role is, you need to know your craft as well as you could. The quality of your work directly helps people in achieving their goals. There are so many things that a product person can do to help an organisation get to a better place, to make work meaningful. Know your craft, experiment, try new things, be curious, explore alternatives, roll up your sleeves, find problems and work with others to find the right solutions. Show, don’t tell and give to receive.</p>
<!--<p>Here's a simply structured use case template that I've found useful for introducing use cases to a wider audience. Of course you can go much deeper and utilize a more sophisticated format, but this one should be a good starting point.</p>-->
			<!--<p>Let's look at an example of a simply structured use case for the now popular game of Hearthstone.</p> -->
			<!--First, here's a sample player turn in the game.
			<video width="400" controls muted style="padding: 5%">
			  <source src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/hearthstone-use-case.mov">

			<p>Now let's jump to our use case.</p>-->
				<!--<div class="use-case-box">	
					<div class="use-case" style="padding: 10px; border: 1px solid black;">
						<p><b>USE CASE NAME:</b> Put a descriptive name that properly summarizes your use case.</p>

						<p><b>ACTORS:</b> List the users who are going to be affected by the different flows. For example Player A, Player B.</p>

						<p><b>PRE-CONDITIONS:</b> 
							<ul>
								<li>Make sure your pre-conditions are specific to the use case.</li>
								<li>What needs to be present to enable the use case?</li>
							    <li>What should have been performed by whom prior to the use case?</li>
							</ul> 
						</p>

						<p><b>BASE FLOW:</b>
							<ul>
								<li>Describe the happy path - the sequence of steps and corresponding system's responses that are going to satisfy most of the actors' needs most of the time.</li>
								<li>Player A initiates action D</li>
								<li>System does X</li>
								<li>Player A performs action E</li>
								<li>System performs process Z</li>
								<li>Player B then performs action D</li>
							</ul>
						</p>

						<p><b>POST-CONDITIONS:</b>
							<ul>
								<li>List what has happened as a result of the Base Flow.</li>
							</ul>
						</p>

						<p><b>ALTERNATE FLOWS:</b>
							<ul>
								<li>List the steps of the flows that are going to happen with lower frequency but are still important to be covered. Say, if you are creating a use case related to accepting credit card payments - maybe there's also going to be an option to pay with PayPal or BitCoin.<br>
								<i>POST-CONDITION:</i> Describe what happens as a result of that alternate flow.</li>
							</ul>
						</p>

						<p><b>EXCEPTION FLOWS:</b>
							<ul>
								<li>In the case related to credit card payments an exception flow would be a card that doesn't have enough balance, or the card number is incorrect or it's a Visa Electron but you don't accept those. Or maybe internet dropped half way through the checkout process. You get the point.<br>
									<i>POST-CONDITION:</i> So what happens in those cases then?</li>
							</ul>

			<!-- <div style="background-color: #c9d1db; padding: 10px;">

					    <li>Both players have selected their starting cards;</li>

						<li>System draws a card from Player A's deck and includes it in the player's hand</li>
						<li>System highlights the available-to-play cards and actions that have mana cost lower or equal to Player A's free mana</li>
						<li>Player A plays an availble-to-play card or action</li>

					</ul>

				<p><b>POST-CONDITIONS:</b>
					<ul>
						<li>If there are triggered card or action effects, the System applies their effects to the playing board, all applicable characters in the game and both players' decks</li>
						<li>If applicable, the System amends the played card or action effects</li>
						<li>System applies the card or action effects to the playing board, all applicable characters in the game, both players' decks and/or the currently active card or action effects in the game</li>
						<li>System updates Player A's free mana</li>

						<li>- Player A attempts to play a card or action that costs more than the player's free mana <br>

						</li>
						<br>
						<li>- Either Player A or Player B leaves the game during the turn<br>
							<i>POST-CONDITION:</i> That player loses the game, while the other one wins it</li>

						<li>- Either Player A or Player B is disconnected<br>
							- System announces that to both players<br>

					<p><b>Mind you, though, that some people are more visual and get lost reading use cases.</b> So in order to make sure that everybody on your team better comprehends the use case, you could supply a flow chart to it. As soon as you have the first draft of your flow chart, go and show it to a Dev and a UX person. Involving your team early in the creation of your use cases and flow charts is key for the success of your product.</p>
					<!--<img src="./img/use-case-flow.png" style="width: 100%">
					<p><b>Finally, if you skip creating use cases, what usually happens</b> from my experience is that you're missing so many alternative and exception flows. Usually those will keep emerging during the development of the feature, creating tension and pushing your promised completion date farther... in turn, creating even more tention. <br>To avoid that, before you write a single user story, create your use cases. Treat a use case as a map of the user stories you need. After all, any product person would benefit from such a map!</p>
