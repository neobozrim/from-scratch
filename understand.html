			<h1>Understand/Data</h1>
			<p>It is not enough to build a product. You need to build a good product. One that solves the right problems. One that creates the opportunities that satisfy your customers' needs.</p>
			<p>To do that, usually, your pure genius alone is not enough. You need to understand how the product that you are building is being used, what it is used for (as many times people use products in unintended ways). You need to understand what the use of your product results in now and what it could result in in the future.</p>
			<p>Part of that understanding will come from user interviews, prototyping, user testing, observation. Part of it will come from a variety of analytics tools and A/B testing. But another part (the gold, the tricky part, the interesting part) will come from your joint work with data analysts and data scientists. It will come from your work with data.</p>
			
			<h2>Data</h2>
			<p>To some, the word data sounds fancy, mythical, mysterious. To others it is just that trendy thing that they collect and say that they use to make data-driven decisions. Many people tend to make a qualitative decision first and then look for data to support it. If they find even a single data point that supports their decision, then it must have been a data-driven decision, right? Wrong. </p>
			<p>You analyse your data first (I intentionally use the word analyse, as simply looking at data isn’t enough in most cases). As a result of your analysis and acquired understanding of the big picture, you can make a decision about that thing that you are specifically interested in. I say analyse and it sounds easy. Sometimes it is and a simple SQL query would tell you what you need to know. Other times it’ll take a team of data scientists months until you start getting closer to something that resembles an answer to the problem that you are trying to solve.</p>
			
			<h2>Problems</h2>
			<p>But does this mean that I shouldn’t make any decisions without data? Of course not. Sometimes you don’t have the needed data, or it will be awhile until you do. Other times you have the data, but you don’t have the time to make sense of that (or the problem is too big to wrap your head around quickly). Yet other times a business trade off requires you to make a decision that is opposite to what your data analysis shows you. What a mess, right? There is only one thing certain - once you start using data as part of your regular work process, there will be more questions than answers. However, if you are smart about how you use data, you’ll end up being better off.</p>
			
			<h2>Patience</h2>
			<p>Getting all of the data points that you need… takes time. Answering all of the important questions that you want to ask… takes more time. Changing our organisation's mindset to a data-driven one… takes probably even longer. If you want your data journey to take you anywhere, you have to be persistent and very patient. Take one step at a time. And accept that your journey through data is more about the travel than the destination. Because there will always be more questions left unanswered than the ones that you’ve found answers to. But the once you got answered will be worth it and you’d want to continue your journey and keep learning more.</p>
			<!--<h2>Google Analytics</h2>
			<p>It was end time I dedicated the time to take the Google Analytics Individual Qualification Exam. The Google Academy courses helped put a fresh perspective on the depth and breadth of analysis you could do with Analytics. My future plans are to test the Google Analytics A/B testing feature with my side project.</p>

			<h2>Google Tag Manager</h2>
			<p>Setting up goals that show on your Analytics Dashboard is much much easier with Tag manager. Later today (13th May 2019) I'm gonna add a few tags in Tag Manager that are going to fire in Analytics. For example I'll be tracking CV downloads from the resources page, clicks on the links to my blog, as well as there'll be a few goals related to how people nagivate through the website. If you're interested, check out this page again around midnight today for it's updated version. You know, there's only as many hours in the day one can work on their portfolio :)</p>

			<h2>Hotjar</h2>
			<p>I use Hotjar for their scrollmaps and heatmaps. Scroll maps are my favourite. It's very useful to know on which pages people just don't bother scrolling to the bottom. That might be a signal to change or reduce some of the content. Btw the feedback tag you see on the right of your screen also comes with Hotjar. You can give it a try!</p>
